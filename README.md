# Factors that impact on the health insurance charges

This project expalins what are the factors that influence the health insurance charges.

## Source: 
Insurance dataset from kaggle  
## Software and tools used: 
Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis

## WorkFlow:
1. Loaded the data using pandas
2. Did the data exploratoty analysis
3. Columns/fields in the dataset are:
       age-refers to the age of the customer.
       gender/sex-refers gender of teh customer.
       children-refers to the number of childredn the customer has.
       Smoker-refere to whether a customer smoker smoker or not.
       Region-refers to the region of the cusotmer
       Charges-refers to the health insurance charges
4. Found the information about dataset
5. Found the statistical information about dataset
6. Encoded the non integer variables
7. Found the correlation and plot the correlation matric among the variables
8. Import the train_test_split from sklearn
9. Defined the dependent and independent variables
10. Split the data for train and test
11. Import thr Linear Regression from sklearn
12. Instantiate the Linear Regression
13. Fit the dependent and independent variables in the model
14. Predicted the values of dependent variable for given independent varirbales
15. Found the mean abolute error, mean squared error and R-square value to find the how the model performance is.
16. Changed the independent variables to get the better performance of the model.  
## Key Isihts to be found 
1. Number of smoking and non smoking customers
2. Number male and female smokers
3. Which age group has more smokers
4. Who has the more charges between smokers and non smokers
5. Correlation between charges and remaining variables
